    "Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems in machine learning that can occur when building models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying patterns. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Overfitting can lead to poor generalization and can be a significant problem when working with small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data. In this case, the model performs poorly both on the training data and new data. Underfitting can occur when the model is not complex enough to represent the relationships between the input and output variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate overfitting, one can use techniques such as regularization, which adds a penalty to the model's parameters to prevent them from becoming too large. Cross-validation can also be used to estimate the model's generalization performance on new data.\n",

    "To mitigate underfitting, one can increase the model's complexity by adding more features or layers, increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layers, or using a more complex model architecture. One can also try to reduce the noise in the data by removing outliers or collecting more data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a statistical method used to estimate the performance of a machine learning model on new data. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple parts and training the model on a subset while testing it on the remaining data. This technique helps to detect overfitting by evaluating the model's performance on new data.\n",

    "Early stopping: Early stopping is a technique used to stop the training of a model when the validation loss starts to increase. This helps to prevent overfitting by stopping the model before it becomes too complex and starts to fit the noise in the data.\n",

    "Dropout: Dropout is a technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks by randomly dropping out some of the neurons during training. This technique helps to prevent the network from relying too heavily on a small subset of neurons and encourages the network to learn more robust representations.\n",
